I really like social media, no to post stuff really but to look at memes, heres the link to my twitter, https://twitter.com/Bre_Bolin. 
heres a meme I like, 

![good meme](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dfcdf5174a820009a1b4a41/lede/1576853802436-chicky-nuggies.jpeg?crop=1xw%3A1xh%3Bcenter%2Ccenter&resize=2000%3A*) "Good Meme"

So now im going to attempt to make a table based on marvel character about who is the best and who is trash. 
| Good Bois      | Trash.         |
|----------------|:--------------:|
|Captain America | Captain Marvel |
|Iron Man        | Ancient One    |
|Loki            | Thanos         |
|Bucky Barns     | Vision         |

This quote gets me weak when ever i hear it, its from the office. In my opinion it is the best quote to come out of the office, since i believ the office is over hyped and there are way better shows.
